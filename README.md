# HeliosX Frontend Take Home Exercise
For this exercise I decided to use Vite template that provides a minumal setup for React app.


## Getting started

```bash
$ npm i # Install the application
$ npm run dev # Run development
```

## To do plan:
- create the wrapper page that will include:
  - header - with logo
  - content - the slide with the questions
  - footer - that has two columns for desk resolution

- create a slide to handle the 5 questions
  - each slide is available after the current slide is answered
  - submit the questionaire after completing the last question - console.log
  - show thank you

- make the entire app responsive (mobile and desktop)


## To do next
 - create component for Question, AnswerButton
 - write unit tests
